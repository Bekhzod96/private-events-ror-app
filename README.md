# README

**Members - Only**

We built a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations. Events take place at a specific date and location..


>Using ruby on rails and bootstrap framework and classes we set up the web app in such a way that users can navigate comfortably for a signup, login logout, and create their events.


## Built With

- Rails 6.0.3
